# Why CloudGraph

Whether you're a cloud architect with 15 years of experience or someone who is just getting started on their cloud journey, there is no denying that understanding the exact current state of your (AWS, Azure, GCP...) environments is challenging, time-consuming work. Even answering basic questions like, "What is running in X region?", "Is X secure and compliant?", or "How much is this cluster going to cost me in July?" requires both time and expertise or expensive 3rd party software.

<br />

**Not anymore.**

<br />

CloudGraph gives anyone working with the cloud superpowers and makes it 🌩️ lightning-fast 🌩️ to answer questions like, "What KMS keys do I have in us-east-1?", "Which VMs have unencrypted storage disks?", and "How much does this EC2 instance actually cost to run per month?". Ask any question about your cloud, and get back answers instantly in a single place with a single standardized API, for all of your cloud providers.

# How It Works

Note that CloudGraph requires **READ ONLY** permissions to run and as such can **never** make any changes to your actual cloud infrastructure.

<br />

Under the hood, CloudGraph reaches out to your cloud provider(s), sucks up all of the configuration data, processes it, and stores a copy of this data for you in [Dgraph](https://dgraph.io/). It then exposes an endpoint at `http://localhost:8997` that allows you to write GraphQL Queries against your stored data. These queries not only allow you do to anything that you would do with say, the AWS SDK/CLI, but they also allow you to run much more powerful queries as well. **Note that none of your cloud's information is ever sent or stored to CloudGraph or third parties.**

<br />

# Authentication

CloudGraph currently supports AWS with Azure/GCP (and several others) coming soon. For more information on generating the necessary permission for each cloud provider please view our current provider repos:

<br />

#### [AWS Provider Repo](https://github.com/cloudgraphdev/cloudgraph-provider-aws)

AWS TLDR; For AWS need you an IAM User with the AWS Managed "ReadOnlyAccess" policy attached. CloudGraph will check to see what AWS user you are using in your current terminal session and use those credentials.

<br />

# Install

Note that installation via homebrew and other platforms is coming soon

<!-- install -->

```bash
npm install -g @cloudgraph/cli
```

<!-- installstop -->

<br />

# Quick Start

You can get up and running with three simple commands:

<br />

<!-- quickstart -->

```bash
cg init
```

1. This initializes CloudGraph's configuration. This command will ask you a series of questions about what providers you are using and how you would like CloudGraph configured.

<p align="center">
  <a href="https://github.com/cloudgraphdev/cli/raw/master/docs/images/init.png">
    <img alt="init" src="https://github.com/cloudgraphdev/cli/raw/master/docs/images/init.png" width="65%" style="display: block; margin: auto"/>
  </a>
</p>

<br/>

---

<br/>

```bash
cg launch
```

<br/>

2. This command launches an instance of [Dgraph](https://dgraph.io/), the graphdb CloudGraph uses to store data under the hood. Note that there are 2 ways to launch an instance. **BOTH** of these require [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) to be installed and running. The preferred solution is to use our `cg launch` convenience command.

<p align="center">
  <a href="https://github.com/cloudgraphdev/cli/raw/master/docs/images/launch.png">
    <img alt="launch" src="https://github.com/cloudgraphdev/cli/raw/master/docs/images/launch.png" width="65%" style="display: block; margin: auto"/>
  </a>
</p>

Note that if you do not want to use this command, for example, if you want to launch the Dgraph container in interactive mode, you can use the docker command below.

```bash
  docker run -it -p 8995:5080 -p 8996:6080 -p 8997:8080 -p 8998:9080 -p 8999:8000 -v ~/dgraph:/dgraph --name dgraph dgraph/standalone:v21.03.0
```

---

<br/>

```bash
cg scan
```

<br/>

3. Scan for infrastructure updates for all configured providers. This command will reach out and read all of the metadata on your cloud assets. Note that it is **completely normal** to see warnings and errors while the `cg scan` command runs, these are usually caused by permissions issues. That said if you find a bug please open an issue on GitHub or let us know in our [Slack Workspace](https://join.slack.com/t/cloudgraph-workspace/shared_invite/zt-vb8whl6u-3YH0F4mHXNyC6SOqZJvClQ).

<p align="center">
  <a href="https://github.com/cloudgraphdev/cli/raw/master/docs/images/scan.png">
    <img alt="scan" src="https://github.com/cloudgraphdev/cli/raw/master/docs/images/scan.png" width="65%" style="display: block; margin: auto"/>
  </a>
</p>

That's it, you are all set to start querying! The query tool you selected during the `cg init` command will then be opened in your preferred browser to run queries, mutations, and visualizations on all of your cloud infrastructure!

<br/>

Note that you may also use **any** GraphQL query tool you would like by connecting it to http://localhost:8997/graphql.

# Example Queries

To use CloudGraph, you will need to be familiar with GraphQL. This section contains a handful of example queries to get you up and running but is by no means exhaustive. If you can dream it up, you can query it! Note that you can find additional example queries in the [examples](examples/) directory. Feel free to make a PR with other examples you would like to see included, check out the [Contribution Guidelines](#contribution-guidelines) section for more information.

<br />

## Basic AWS Examples:

For a list of currently supported AWS services please see the [AWS Provider Repo](https://github.com/cloudgraphdev/cloudgraph-provider-aws). For the purposes of these examples we will just request the IDs and ARNs of AWS resources to keep things brief, but you can query whatever attributes you want.

<br />

Get the `ID` and `ARN` of a single `EC2 instance`:

```graphql
query {
  getawsEc2(
    arn: "arn:aws:ec2:us-east-1:123445678997:instance/i-12345567889012234"
  ) {
    id
    arn
  }
}
```

<br />

Get the `ID` and `ARN` of each `EC2` in your entire AWS account:

```graphql
query {
  queryawsEc2 {
    id
    arn
  }
}
```

<br />

Get the `ID` and `ARN` of each `EC2` in `"us-east-1"` using a regex to search the `ARN`:

```graphql
query {
  queryawsEc2(filter: { arn: { regexp: "/.*us-east-1.*/" } }) {
    id
    arn
  }
}
```

<br />

Do the same thing but checking to see that the `region` is equal to `"us-east-1"` instead of using a regex:

```graphql
query {
  queryawsEc2(filter: { region: { eq: "us-east-1" } }) {
    id
    arn
  }
}
```

<br />

Do the same thing but checking to see that the `region` contains `"us-east-1"` in the name instead of using eq:

```graphql
query {
  queryawsEc2(filter: { region: { in: "us-east-1" } }) {
    id
    arn
  }
}
```

<br />

Get the `ID` and `ARN` of each `M5` series `EC2 instance` in `"us-east-1"`

```graphql
query {
  queryawsEc2(
    filter: { region: { eq: "us-east-1" }, instanceType: { regexp: "/^m5a*/" } }
  ) {
    id
    arn
  }
}
```

<br />

Do the same thing but skip the first found result (i.e. `offset: 1`) and then only return the first two results after that (i.e. `first: 2`) and order those results by AZ in ascending order (`order: { asc: availabilityZone }`) so that instance(s) in `"us-east-1a"` are returned at the top of the list.

```graphql
query {
  queryawsEc2(
    filter: { region: { eq: "us-east-1" }, instanceType: { regexp: "/^m5a*/" } }
    order: { asc: availabilityZone }
    first: 2
    offset: 1
  ) {
    id
    arn
  }
}
```

<br />

Do the same thing but also include the `EBS Volume` that is the boot disk for each `EC2 instance`:

```graphql
query {
  queryawsEc2(
    filter: { region: { eq: "us-east-1" }, instanceType: { regexp: "/^m5a*/" } }
    order: { asc: availabilityZone }
    first: 2
    offset: 1
  ) {
    id
    arn
    ebs(filter: { isBootDisk: true }, first: 1) {
      id
      arn
      isBootDisk
    }
  }
}
```

<br />

Do the same thing, but also include the `SGs` and `ALBs` for each `EC2`. For the `ALBs`, get the `EC2s` that they are connected to along with the `ID` and `ARN` of each found `EC2 instance` (i.e. a circular query).

```graphql
query {
  queryawsEc2(
    filter: { region: { eq: "us-east-1" }, instanceType: { regexp: "/^m5a*/" } }
    order: { asc: availabilityZone }
    first: 2
    offset: 1
  ) {
    id
    arn
    ebs(filter: { isBootDisk: true }, first: 1) {
      id
      arn
      isBootDisk
    }
    securityGroups {
      id
      arn
    }
    alb {
      id
      arn
      ec2Instance {
        id
        arn
      }
    }
  }
}
```

<br />

Get each `VPC`, the `ALBs` and `Lambdas` in that `VPC`, and then a bunch of nested sub-data as well... you get the idea.

```graphql
query {
  queryawsVpc {
    id
    arn
    alb {
      id
      arn
      ec2Instance {
        id
        arn
        ebs(filter: { isBootDisk: true }) {
          id
          arn
        }
      }
    }
    lambda {
      id
      arn
      kms {
        id
        arn
      }
    }
  }
}
```

<br />

## AWS real-world use cases:

<br />

Find all the unencrypted `EBS Volumes`:

```graphql
query {
  queryawsEbs(filter: { encrypted: false }) {
    id
    arn
    availabilityZone
    encrypted
  }
}
```

<br />

Find all the `KMS` keys in `"us-east-1"`:

```graphql
query {
  queryawsKms(filter: { arn: { regexp: "/.*us-east-1.*/" } }) {
    id
    arn
    description
    enableKeyRotation
    tags {
      key
      value
    }
  }
}
```

<br />

Find all the burstable `T` series instances:

```graphql
query {
  queryawsEc2(filter: { instanceType: { regexp: "/^t.*/" } }) {
    id
    arn
    availabilityZone
    instanceType
  }
}
```

<br />

Find the default `VPCs`:

```graphql
query {
  queryawsVpc(filter: { defaultVpc: true }) {
    id
    arn
    defaultVpc
    state
  }
}
```

<br />

Find the public `ALBs`:

```graphql
query {
  queryawsAlb(filter: { scheme: { eq: "internet-facing" } }) {
    id
    arn
    dnsName
    createdAt
    tags {
      key
      value
    }
  }
}
```

<br />

Find all of the `EC2s`, `Lambdas`, and `VPCs` that have a `Tag` value of `"Production"`:

```graphql
query {
  queryawsTag(filter: { value: { eq: "Production" } }) {
    key
    value
    ec2Instance {
      id
      arn
    }
    lambda {
      id
      arn
    }
    vpc {
      id
      arn
    }
  }
}
```

<br />

Do the same thing but look for both a `key` and a `value`:

```graphql
query {
  queryawsTag(
    filter: {  key: { eq: "Environment" }, value: { eq: "Production" } }
  ) {
    key
    value
    ec2Instance {
      id
      arn
    }
    lambda {
      id
      arn
    }
    vpc {
      id
      arn
    }
  }
}
```

<br />

Do the same thing using `getawsTag` instead of `queryawsTag`. Note that when searching for tags using `getawsTag` your must specify **both** the `key` and `value` as the `id` like is done below with `"Environment:Production"`:

```graphql
query {
  getawsTag(id: "Environment:Production") {
    key
    value
    ec2Instance {
      id
      arn
    }
    lambda {
      id
      arn
    }
    vpc {
      id
      arn
    }
  }
}
```

<br />

### Limitations

Today, the biggest limitation with CloudGraph and our query abilities is we don't support nested filtering based on child attributes. So for example, as cool as it would be to do the following, it's just not possible yet:

```graphql
query {
  queryawsEc2(filter: { ebs: { isBootDisk: true } }) {
    id
    arn
    ebs {
      id
      arn
    }
  }
}
```

This is actually not a limitation of CloudGraph, but rather a feature that still needs to be implemented with Dgraph. [You can view and comment on the discussion thread here](https://discuss.dgraph.io/t/proposal-nested-object-filters-for-graphql-rewritten-as-var-blocks-in-dql/12252/2)

# Query Tools

<!-- querytools -->

CloudGraph ships with 2 awesome query tools and a GraphQL schema explorer. Remember, you can use **ANY** GraphQL query tool if you would prefer another option, just connect it to your exposed `/graphql` endpoint!

<br />

## [GraphQL Playground](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-playground)

GraphQL playground has a fluid and engaging UX that is great for querying a GraphQL schema quickly and simply. It has built-in automatically generated documentation and auto-completion while you type. To access playground, either select it as your preferred query tool in the `init` command OR visit `/playground` in the server CG spins up.
